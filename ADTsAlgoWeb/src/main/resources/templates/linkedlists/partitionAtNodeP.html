    <h1>Partitioning a list a node with value P</h1>

    <p>
        This algorithm partitions a singly linked list about a node with value P, such that all nodes which precede it
        have lower values and nodes which proceed it have equal or higher values. The ordering within each partition is not
        necessarily ordered numerically.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="lang-java">
        private LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; head;

        public PartitionAtNodeP(LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
            this.head = list;
        }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The supplied list can be ordered or unordered. The original tail node reference is recorded. The method works by first
        establishing the head node, sending all nodes at the start of the list, which have higher values, to the end
        of the list. This check continues until the first node with a value less than P is found. The second stage then
        proceeds to process all remaining nodes located before the original tail (those after it have already been
        shuffled to the end anyway). Any node which is greater than or equal to the partitioning value is sent to the back of the
        list. Time complexity is always O(n), with all nodes processed in sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
        The method partition() returns a reference to the new head node.
