    <h1>Compressing a string</h1>

    <p>
        A string can be shortened by replacing consecutive, repeated characters with the repeated character followed by
        a digit that indicates the number of times the character is repeated. For example, "dooodleZOOOoM" becomes
        "do3dleZO3oM".
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="lang-java">
        private final String input;

        public StringCompression(String input){
            this.input = input;
        }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        A compressed string is built as pointer i traverses along this.input. Pointer j is never behind pointer i, and
        looks for repeated characters, tallying an integer, tally, the value of which forms the basis of the repeated
        set of characters.
    </p>

        <code>
        // time complexity is O(i + j) (higher indices i would reduce j, and vice versa for consecutive elements) or just O(n)
        public String compress(){
            //i tail pointer, j lead pointer, k traverses compressedString[]
            int i = 0, j, k = 0;
            char[] compressedString = new char[this.input.length()];

            while (i < this.input.length()){
                compressedString[k++] = this.input.charAt(i);
                int tally = 1;      // there is one of compressedString[i]

                // pointer j moves one element ahead of pointer i and looks for repeated characters
                for (j = i+1; j < this.input.length(); j++){
                    if (this.input.charAt(i) == this.input.charAt(j)){
                        tally++;
                    } else {
                        // no repeated characters, let i catch up to j
                        break;
                    }
                }
                i = j;

                // add digit if there are repeated characters
                if (tally > 1) {
                    compressedString[k++] = Character.forDigit(tally, 10);
                }
            }
            return new String(compressedString).replace("\0", "");
        }
